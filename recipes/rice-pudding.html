    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Adults and kids alike love <strong>baked rice pudding</strong>, which can be a healthy dessert choice after a big meal. It's best when made with fresh whole milk and chilled several hours before serving. </p>

    <p>Some Turkish folks still go out of their way to seek out fresh, unpasteurized milk to make <em>fırın sütlaç</em>. It's said that the tricks to making perfect rice pudding are fresh milk, slow cooking, constant stirring, and lots of patience.</p>
    
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cups water, or enough to cover rice</li>
        <li>4 3/4 cups plus 3 tablespoons whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Gather the ingredients. Heat the oven to 350 F / 180 C.</li>
       <li>In a colander, rinse the rice until the water runs clear.</li>
       <li>In a large saucepan, add the rice and enough water to cover it by about 1/2 inch.</li>
       <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Let the rice simmer gently until it's softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add 3 3/4 cups of the milk along with the sugar and vanilla extract to the rice. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it boil very gently for about 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>In a small bowl, use a whisk to mix 1 cup of the milk and the cornstarch until smooth.</li>
       <li>While stirring, gradually pour the milk-cornstarch mixture into the rice.</li>
       <li>Turn up the heat and continue stirring the pudding until scalding, about 4 to 5 minutes.</li> 
       <li>When the pudding thickens, continue to stir, and cook for about 2 minutes more.</li>
       <li>Remove from the heat and fill small, ovenproof dessert cups, clay cups, or disposable aluminum pudding cups with the hot mixture.</li>
       <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg yolk with the remaining 3 tablespoons of milk.</li>
       <li>Using a spoon, drizzle a small amount of the egg-milk mixture into the center of each dessert cup.</li>
       <li>With the back of the spoon, use a light, circular motion to swirl the egg yolk from the center to the edges so it spreads evenly over the top of each cup.</li>
       <li>Bake the pudding cups until the tops are nicely browned, about 20 minutes.</li>
       <li>Let the cups cool at room temperature and then refrigerate for several hours before serving. Enjoy.</li>
